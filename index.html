      <h1>What are endangered species?</h1>
      <p class="intro-p">
        Endangered species are those plants and animals that have become so rare
        they are in danger of becoming extinct. Threatened species are plants
        and animals that are likely to become endangered within the foreseeable
        future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
        <br />
        Some examples can be seen below

          <h2>The Asian Elephant</h2>
          <p>
            The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic
            elephant, is the only living species of the genus Elephas.The Asian
            elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent.
            <br />
            Asian elephants are extremely sociable, forming groups of six to
            seven related females that are led by the oldest female, the
            matriarch. Like African elephants, these groups occasionally join
            others to form larger herds, although these associations are
            relatively short-lived. In Asia, elephant herd sizes are
            significantly smaller than those of savannah elephants in Africa.

          <h2>Giant Panda</h2>
          <p>
            The panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), with its distinctive black and
            white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national
            treasure in China. Despite their exalted status and relative lack of
            natural predators, pandas are still at risk. Severe threats from
            humans have left just over 1,800 pandas in the wild.
            <br />
            China’s Yangtze Basin region holds the panda’s primary habitat.
            Infrastructure development (such as dams, roads, and railways) is
            increasingly fragmenting and isolating panda populations, preventing
            pandas from finding new bamboo forests and potential mates.

          <h2>Cross River Gorilla</h2>
          <p>
            Cross River Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli).
            <br />This population risks inbreeding and a loss of genetic
            diversity because there are so few Cross River gorillas and they
            live in groups that interact infrequently if at all. The hunting and
            killing of gorillas is illegal in Cameroon and Nigeria, but
            enforcement of wildlife laws is often lax. <br />Following
            conservation efforts, hunting has declined to a low level, but any
            amount of gorilla killing will have a significantly impact an
            already small population. <br />
            Efforts to protect these animals are focused on securing the forests
            that house them.
            <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/" target="_blank">WWF</a> and
            partners have worked with the governments of Cameroon and Nigeria to
            create a protected area for the Cross River gorilla that spans the
            border of these two nations.

          <h2>Orangutan</h2>
          <p>
            Orangutan (Pongo abelii, Pongo pygmaeus). <br />
            The name orangutan means "man of the forest" in the Malay language.
            In the lowland forests in which they reside, orangutans live
            solitary existences. They feast on wild fruits like lychees,
            mangosteens, and figs, and slurp water from holes in trees. They
            make nests in trees of vegetation to sleep at night and rest during
            the day. Known for their distinctive red fur, orangutans are the
            largest arboreal mammal, spending most of their time in trees. Long,
            powerful arms and grasping hands and feet allow them to move through
            the branches. These great apes share 96.4% of our genes and are
            highly intelligent creatures.

          Roughly 99 percent of threatened species are at risk because of human
          activities alone. <br />
          By the early 21st century it could be said that human beings (Homo
          sapiens) are the greatest threat to biodiversity!
